  well known names including Pascal Coste in salons in the South of France and on the prestigious
  Boulevard Haussman in Paris. He also worked in the special events domain.`,
  textPart2: `After having managed large teams and being in charge of developing new salons Marss decided

  textPart3: `After taking a couple of years off to renovate his house he had the opportunity to take over the
  salon in Allemans du Dropt and it was too good to miss, so the new salon Marss Number 30 (
  Marss numéro 30) opened in September 2019.`,
  textPart4: `Marss already has a faithful and very happy clientele who are delighted to find a touch of Parisian
  expertise in their local village and the fact that he speaks English thanks to his British wife is a plus
